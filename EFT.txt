Escape From Tarkov

Game using Unity 19, BattlEye, custom FileChecker, Custom Checks, Custom Obfuscation.

Doing the funny

de4dot is great at deobfuscating the Assembly-CSharp, Comfort.Unity or Comfort.

Bypass its checks:
Because FilesChecker.dll is a C# file you can edit in dnSpy to remove it.
In Method:
FilesChecker.ConsistencyMetadataProvider.GetConsistencyMetadata

You can just return an empty array. And it doesnt check for any files.

Custom check.
ConsistencyInfo is just a json file. you can edit it.

Dumping
Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll contains BattlEye code.

BattlEye.DecryptPacket, BattlEye.EncryptPacket contains both the dec, and the enc packet, you can dump both.
