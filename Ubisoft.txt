The Beginning

Ah yes, ubisoft, the company that is great at fucking up, and not liking customers.

Currently most of the communication goes tru TLS and HTTP, most of game server operate at UDP.

The Network
Ubisoft uses protobuf in the Demux server and UbiServices (Custom made after Massgate, kinda like a fork) for every HTTPS.

UbiServices using NGINX for good use.

For UDP communication they usually use PRUDP on old games.

The Protection
Most of games, application protected by Denuvo, VMP.
